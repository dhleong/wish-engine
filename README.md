wish-engine
===========

*It makes [WISH][1] go*

## What?

The `wish-engine` project provides the scripting runtime that powers [WISH][1]
Data Sources.

## How?

For now, the best way to learn how to create new data sources is to check out
the [builtin D&D5E data source][2]. The (work-in-progress) scripting
documentation is generated from source, and can be found at [cljdoc][3], with
the latest snapshot always available [here][4].
